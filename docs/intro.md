# My take to microservices vs monoliths

As a backend developer and system architect, the biggest decision I have to make is how to balance the trade-offs
of being simple, efficient, and scalable: keep the system in a monolithic architecture or split it into microservices.

### Microservices

It’s usually considered as the advanced choice by most developers. Indeed, yes, it’s the ultimate solution. And the team
can enjoy some benefits other than performance and scalability, like independent deployment, minimized downtime,
flexible technology stack, etc. I can understand why developers are so keen on it. However, the trade-offs are
also obvious: complexity and cost. It’s just too hard! Every time, some of developers suggest to use a microservices
architecture, I question whether we can do it right. To be honest, even I am not that confident, especially
after certain updates. Please take a look at this if you question it.

I can't stop laughing every time I watch it, but it's bloody true. You may read the comments and the [ThePrimeTime's reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-vJcOfrvi0) to it.
That’s not hard to understand, right? Just consider the spaghetti code you’ve ever written and imagine
they are now in network calls—an absolute nightmare.

### Monolith

I do love monoliths. If we can’t foresee a million users or thousands of concurrency, who needs microservices?
It’s way easier to develop, deploy, and maintain. No need to worry about service discovery, inter-service
portals, network drops, latency, blocking, timeouts, etc. And as hardware performance and CI/CD techniques
improve, a monolith on a 100+ core server with proper pipelines can well support thousands of transactions per second
with minimal downtime. And remember, google search only have 40K rps.
And also, when a single monolith can’t handle it alone, it can still scale itself horizontally;
I would say >90% of the time it’s sufficient.

### Modular Monolith

After considering all the pros and cons, developers nowadays seem not that into microservices. Big tech
companies like Amazon and Google are moving some of their less intensive products back to monoliths.
But of course, these are big companies, and they always prepare for growing fast and big in the foreseeable future.
So modular monoliths approach is their choice. In short, it’s some microservices running in the same process
but still calling each other through network APIs. It’s obviously easier than microservices and yet more
scalable than an ordinary monolith. But from my understanding, it’s not that ideal, just like the graph below.

The overhead of coding is still there no matter if you use RESTful, gRPC, or MQ. It requires a lot more
effort to manage the communication. And obviously, the performance overhead is there since it uses network
calls regardless of the fact that they are in the same process. Even if they can overcome that with some
helper like a fake client/server, it still increases the cost of implementation/splitting. Moreover, in
case it needs to split one day, the cost is still not that low, especially when taking deployment into
consideration.

## My attempt: Kitchen

After all of these, I’ve come up with my own solution: Kitchen. I’ve set some goals for it:

1. Minimal development overhead
1. Minimal performance overhead
1. Seamless scaling
1. Manageable call stack
1. Manageable dependencies

### How it works

The core concept of Kitchen is to create placeholders for all major functions. These placeholders define the input, output, and dependencies required for execution. Function bodies can then be assigned to these placeholders.

At runtime, functions are invoked from the placeholders. This allows for the integration of additional logic such as logging, tracing, metrics, callbacks, and more into the function calls without messing up the code.

And most importantly, since execution is called via placeholders, it is not necessarily executed in local. Let's see how it hit my goals!

### Minimal development overhead

The major overhead of using Kitchen is to predefine the placeholders before coding the actual logic.

```go
type SomeTaskes struct {
    kitchen.MenuBase[*SomeTaskes, *SomeDependecy]
    Task1 kitchen.Dish[*SomeDependecy, *Input1, *Output1]
    Task2 kitchen.Dish[*SomeDependecy, *Input2, *Output2]
}

someTaskes := kitchen.InitMen(&SomeTaskes{}, &SomeDependecy{})
someTaskes.Task1.SetCooker(func(dep *SomeDependecy, input *Input1, output *Output1) {
    // do something
})
someTaskes.Task2.SetCooker(doSomethingFn)

output1, err := someTaskes.Task1.Cook(input1)
```

It takes some time, of course, but compared to drafting APIs, it’s way easier. And Kitchen provides convenient
plugins for turning the placeholders into web APIs, generating OpenAPI schema, and gRPC adapter, etc.

### Minimal performance overhead

To have a framework for real battles, I try hard to put performance into first place, minimize the
use of reflect or map. It makes the local call overhead is as low as <400ns, and <10000ns for foreign calls.

The network helper is based on [ZeroMQ](https://github.com/go-zeromq/zmq4), which is a high-throughput,
low-latency networking library.
It’s way faster than HTTP and gRPC, and I’ve further improved it by implementing a 2-way data socket.
Every separated node will have a pool of TCP connections for sending requests, but unlike traditional
network calls, they don’t wait/block. And every node will have a listening port handled with a single
goroutine; then requests will pass to the corresponding goroutine through channels. After the request
is processed, the response will be sent back through the request connections targeted to the requester.
This two-way data flow enabled a true async call, which is optimal for microservices use cases.

Note that the network helper is interchangeable, you can implement other helper to suit the requirement,
for example a MQ adapter is ideal for services require the highest level of durability.

### Seamless scaling

The network helper is designed to be configurable at runtime; services can easily replicate themselves
into horizontal monoliths. Or they can even toggle feature scopes at runtime to become single responsibility
services. The changes can be made by CI/CD pipeline or even APIs without restarting. The core logic can stay
unchanged as long as the dependencies are managed properly and the placeholders are properly defined.

### Manageable call stack

Metrics, logging, tracing, etc. are easy to implement; you can easily add them to the placeholders. The logger,
tracer plugins are provided by default, and additional plugins can be added by either the tracer interface or
as an afterCook callback. Consider the placeholder as an internal URI; you can add all the things you previously
did with middlewares to it.

It also comes with a concurrent limit control mechanism, which helps to prevent part of a service from draining
all the resources. Unfortunately, the memory profile library provided by Golang messes up the generic type, so
I can’t provide memory limit control.

### Manageable dependencies

It’s important to keep dependencies manageable as we aim to split the modules one day. It supports both singleton
or factory/sync pool patterns. And they are injected into the function body inside the context parameter.

I am planning to add a dependency initialization and dispose interface to let Kitchen prepare it for the
corresponding functions that are enabled and release resources when they are disabled.

And it can perform some extra logic like server middlewares by implementing certain interfaces, for example,
IWebParsableInput for parsing web requests into input and handling sessions, ACL, etc.

### Conclusion

As a system architect, I am always dreaming of a perfect solution that can balance all the trade-offs,
something that’s easy to develop, deploy, and maintain, yet scalable and efficient. One set of code suits
all the scenarios with minimal modification, progressively scaling as the business grows.

Kitchen is my attempt to achieve this. I will keep improving it and hope it can help you as well. Any feedback
is welcome.
